    - Documenting APIs (Swagger/OpenAPI)
    - Rate limiting and throttling

12. **Web Sockets and Real-Time Communication**
    - Setting up WebSocket connections
    - Implementing real-time features (e.g., chat, notifications)
    - Managing WebSocket events and messages

13. **Task Scheduling and Background Jobs**
    - Scheduling periodic tasks (cron jobs)
    - Implementing background job processing (e.g., Celery, Bull)
    - Managing task queues

14. **Data Validation and Serialization**
    - Validating incoming data (e.g., Joi, Marshmallow)
    - Serializing and deserializing data (e.g., Marshmallow, Pydantic)
    - Implementing custom validation logic

15. **Testing**
    - Writing unit tests for backend logic
    - Creating integration tests for API endpoints
    - Setting up test environments and databases
    - Using testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, PyTest)

16. **Security Practices**
    - Implementing HTTPS
    - Mitigating common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
    - Using security headers
    - Managing sensitive data (e.g., environment variables, secrets)

17. **Performance Optimization**
    - Profiling and monitoring performance
    - Implementing performance enhancements (e.g., query optimization, load balancing)
    - Scaling applications (horizontal, vertical)

18. **DevOps and Deployment**
    - Containerizing applications with Docker
    - Setting up CI/CD pipelines
    - Deploying to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
    - Monitoring and logging (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack)

19. **GraphQL (Optional)**
    - Setting up a GraphQL server
    - Defining schemas and resolvers
    - Querying and mutating data with GraphQL

20. **Documentation**
    - Writing clear and concise documentation for APIs
    - Creating README files and project documentation
    - Using tools like Swagger for API documentation

   - Develop a backend for an e-commerce platform.
   - Implement product listings, user authentication, and order processing.
   - Handle payment integration and inventory management.

3. **Blog Platform**
   - Create a backend for a blogging platform.
   - Implement user registration, post creation, and comment functionality.
   - Use a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) and a caching layer.

4. **Real-Time Chat Application**
   - Build a real-time chat backend using WebSockets.
   - Implement user authentication and message persistence.
   - Handle user presence and message broadcasting.

5. **Task Scheduler**
   - Create a task scheduler that runs periodic tasks.
   - Implement a job queue and background job processing.
